      <h1> About the RoboTeam </h1>
      <p>
          RoboTeam Twente is a multidisciplinary team of students from the University of Twente.
          We aspire to innovate in both robotics and artificial intelligence.
          Next, we want to inspire everyone for these two sectors and show the world what can be achieved with them.
          We believe robotics and artificial intelligence can make the world a better place if used correctly.

      </p>
      <p>
        Our medium to achieve these goals is the RoboCup, this year in Sydney.
        The RoboCup hosts multiple competitions for soccer and rescue robots as well as robots that can help at home or on the work floor.
        We will compete at the world championship of robot soccer in which two teams of six small robots will compete with each other.

        This is the second year the team participates in the RoboCup. The team consists of students from different backgrounds,
        such as Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science and Advanced Technology.

        In the DesignLab of the University of Twente we have a special soccer field,
         on which we will frequently test our robots and in the near future play practice matches.
        If you donâ€™t want to miss anything of our progress and if you want to be notified when we are going to practice, follow us on Facebook or Linkedin!
