          <p>
            This year we decided it is time to go for the win. The first year we participated we reached the 14th place, and last year we reached the 7th place. 14, 7, ... 1? Third time is a charm!

            Roboteam Twente provides demonstrations for companies and high schools to educate people about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. If you donate you can get a live demonstration of our robots!

          <h3> We share our knowledge with the world </h3>
          <p>
            We have computer scientists to improve on the stability of the software, and we have physicists and mathematicians to work on advanced algorithms to make our robots really shine on the field. Some of these algorithms can be very pretty; the banner at the top of this page shows a Voronoi diagram, which is use in the algorithms we also use during matches! After the robocup we will make our 'inventions' public.

        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5"> Components </h1>
        <p>
          Making robots is expensive. Altough we will not build completely new robots this year, we still need to upgrade them with new components. Because we need to improve the communication between the robot and our basestation we also need new chipsets to process even more data. If we raise enough money we can even add cameras to the robots themselves to participate in the Robocup Technical Challenge!

        <p>
          Also participating in the Robocup requires a certain amount of money. We need to travel to Australia and stay there for a week. This won't be a holiday though; we will most likely use our jetlag to work through the night to make the robots perform as good as possible! (After the robocup we will all go on a hopefully well-deserved holiday which we will entirely pay ourselves).

        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5"> A new office </h1>
        <p>
          Our current office is not suitable for 15 teammembers, which means that currently a few of us are mostly working at home. Also our airconditioning is not functioning properly. We have extensive plans for moving to a new office in 2019. In that office we will have a small football field to run tests from our desk.
